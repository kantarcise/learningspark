/**
 * Instead of the system clock time, an event-time timeout is
 * based on the event time in the data (similar to time-based
 * aggregations) and a watermark defined on the event time.
 *
 * If a key is configured with a specific timeout timestamp
 * of T (i.e., not a duration), then that key will time out when
 * the watermark exceeds T if no new data was
 * received for that key since the last time the function was called.
 *
 * This is great, because unlike with processing-time timeouts any
 * slowdown or downtime in query processing will not cause spurious
 * timeouts.
